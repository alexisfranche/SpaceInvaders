# Space Invaders in VHDL

Program that runs the Space Invaders game on the CycloneV altera FPGA board.

The complete project was programmed in VHDL and ran on the board which displayed the output on a computer screen using a VGA cable.
Project consisted of building a finite state machine outlining the important transitions of the game, building the sprite ROMs,
the behaviour of the aliens and spaceship, and making sure that the image would properly execute at a specific clock frequency.
